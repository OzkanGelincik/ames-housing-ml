    "# Machine Learning Project - Ames Housing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Ames, Iowa is the college town of **Iowa State University**. The Ames housing dataset consists of about $2500$ house sale records between $2006-2010$. Detailed information about the house attributes, along with the sale prices, is recorded in the dataset. The goal of the project is to:\n",
    "- perform descriptive data analysis to gain business (i.e. housing market) insights\n",
    "- build descriptive machine learning models to understand the local housing market.\n",
    "- build predictive machine learning models for the local house price prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subset of the **Ames** dataset is hosted on [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) as an entry-level regression competition. You may visit their site for some information on the meanings of its data columns (the data dictionary). In this notebook, we will describe various project ideas related to this data."
